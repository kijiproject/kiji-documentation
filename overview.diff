+KijiExpress is designed to make defining data processing jobs faster and more
+expressive, particularly for data stored in Kiji tables. KijiExpress allows you
+to define pipelines of MapReduce jobs easily, particularly when dealing with Kiji tables.
 
-KijiExpress is designed from the point of view of analysts, with the aim to lower the barrier to writing 
-complex map reduce jobs to express algorithms. In particular, it lets you think about your data as a collection
-and perform a series of transformations on it, just as you would on a simpler, in memory collection.
 
-In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to use KijiExpress to analyze your data effectively. Specifically,
-we get you started on the beginnings of a music recommendation engine.
+In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to use KijiExpress to analyze your data effectively. You will:
 
-You will learn to:
 * Quickly and efficiently import data into a KijiTable.
-* Define a KijiExpress pipeline that counts the number of times songs have been played,
-and further find the most popular song played after a given song.
-* Run KijiExpress scripts locally and verify the output for jobs.
-* Work with complex avro types in pipelines.
+* Define a KijiExpress pipeline that reads from a KijiTable and counts occurances of an event.
+* Run KijiExpress jobs locally and verify the output for jobs.
+* Work with complex Avro types in pipelines.
